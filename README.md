My name is Phillip, I am a recent graduate software engineer.
I started learning JavaScript via CodeAcademy in Highschool and ended up going to University to study.

I love working on Discord Bots and Webapps due to the interactive nature possible.

My most recent fascination has been Noise, such as Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise.
